# JAVA SCRIPT
JavaScript є найпопулярнішою мовою програмування у світі.
JavaScript — це мова програмування Інтернету.<br />
# VARIABLES
Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:
Automatically
- Using var
- Using let
- Using const
```javascript
Example using var
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```
# JavaScript Operators
There are different types of JavaScript operators:
- Arithmetic Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Comparison Operators
- String Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Ternary Operators
- Type Operators
  
```javascript
Arithmetic Operators Example

let a = 3;
let x = (100 + 50) * a;
Example

let text1 = "20";
let text2 = "5";
let result = text1 < text2;
```
# JavaScript Objects
You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.
This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:
```javascript
let car = "Fiat";
```
```javascript
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
```
# JavaScript Arrays
If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:
```javascript
let car1 = "Saab";
let car2 = "Volvo";
let car3 = "BMW";
```
You access an array element by referring to the index number:
```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let car = cars[0];
```
Note: Array indexes start with 0.
[0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.

# JavaScript Loops
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
Often this is the case when working with arrays:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
```
Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:<br />
for - loops through a block of code a number of times<br />
for/in - loops through the properties of an object<br />
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object<br />
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true<br />
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

# JavaScript Booleans
Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like<br />
- YES / NO
- ON / OFF
- TRUE / FALSE
For this, JavaScript has a Boolean data type. It can only take the values true or false.
```javascript
Example
Boolean(10 > 9)
```
# JavaScript if, else, and else if
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.
You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.
In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
```javascript
Example
If the hour is less than 18, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise "Good evening":

if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
```
# JavaScript Strings
JavaScript strings are for storing and manipulating text.
A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.
```javascript
Example
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes
```

# JavaScript Date Objects
JavaScript Date Objects let us work with dates:
```javascript
Examples
const d = new Date("October 13, 2014 11:13:00");
```

# JavaScript Functions
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
```javascript
Example
// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}
```
**Function Return**
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.
Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":
```javascript
Example
Calculate the product of two numbers, and return the result:

// Function is called, the return value will end up in x
let x = myFunction(4, 3);

function myFunction(a, b) {
// Function returns the product of a and b
  return a * b;
}
```

# JavaScript Classes
ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.
JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.
```javascript
Example
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
}
```
