### Introduction

I am glad you get here, so we can know each other better, build efficient, scalable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) applications. I am open to progressive JavaScript, yet still using pure JavaScript but planning to move into fully supports [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

I very like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is something that I use pretty often on server-side but I am open to any alternative like [Koa](https://koajs.com/) or [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify)! Usually I prefer to work with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) but I am open to any other database, specially if it's popular like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

On the client-side I prefer to use one of three giants, which is [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and they can cover any large application. When we

waw provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.

#### Philosophy

In recent years, thanks to Node.js, JavaScript has become the “lingua franca” of the web for both front and backend applications. This has given rise to awesome projects like [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), which improve developer productivity and enable the creation of fast, testable, and extensible frontend applications. However, while plenty of superb libraries, helpers, and tools exist for Node (and server-side JavaScript), none of them effectively solve the main problem of - **Architecture**.

waw provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications. The architecture is heavily inspired by Angular.
